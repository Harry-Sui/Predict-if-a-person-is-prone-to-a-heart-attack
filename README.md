# Random Forest Model to predict if a person is prone to a heart attack or not
---
##### ‘Your eating habits affect the health of your heart and blood vessels in a number of ways.’ Although food is very important to our body. However, I also want to know what other factors can affect our heart health. The data I used in this study is recorded 303 cases with 13 characteristics of the human body. I hope to find out which of these characteristics can affect our heart health through this research. So, through the characteristics (as ‘age’, ‘sex’, ‘Resting blood pressure’, etc.) of a person, we can judge the possibility of a ‘heart attack’.
##### I have submitted the photos used for this project.
